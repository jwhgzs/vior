# Vior
A mini copy of Vue made on my own. Just to practice understanding Vue's principle.  
How did I choose this name? Just like Evan You, using the translator!

# About me (author)
Please allow me to brag about myself...

My name is Jason, and my Chinese name is "谭镇洋" (Zhenyang, Tan), a 14-year-old boy. I'm a middle school student from China. I'm a boarder so that I can only program at weekends (exclude some special condition like holidays).

I have programmed since I was a 4th grader primary school student in 2017, but I did nothing special during 2 years after it, I had just learnt E4A (a Chinese Android IDE), Java and C# shallowly.

In 2020, the year I was going to be a middle school student, I started to learn Javascript and HTML. I tried several frameworks like JQuery and Bootstrap, and used them to make my own "offical" website <https://www.jwhgzs.com> to practise my JS and HTML.

Finally, I found Vue. I had known Vue before, but I didn't even know it's a JS framework. I started to use Vue just to use Vuexy (I thought 'Vuexy' means a UI package used in Vue's app). Then I just tried Vue, and I shouted: "Oh my god, my dream comes true!"

I have been active in Vue's ecosystem since then. I'm using Nuxt for SSR in my new "offical" website now, try Nuxt and you'll get suprise!

I started this project Vior just because I saw a middle school team called [Bug-Duck](https://github.com/Bug-Duck), they made a JS framework [TNT.js](https://github.com/Bug-Duck/tntjs) like Vue, and bragged about it. My internal drive for exellence motivated me to make one on my own. And I searched some data about Vue, learned some core principle of it, then I made it without help in a week overall (6 days from Vior v0.1.0 to v0.2.11, Sep. 2022). Now I'm better than a team!

What? Are you surprise with my English? LOL. I try my best to write in English by myself, and I'll use the translator in some special condition. Maybe programming makes my a lot stronger vocabulary and express ability than most middle school students. But I may make some funny language mistakes sometime, so your advice is most welcome!
