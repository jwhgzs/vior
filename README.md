# Vior
A mini copy of Vue made on my own.  
How did I choose this name? Just like Evan You, using the translator!

# Features & TODOs
- ✅ Basic reactivity:
	- refs (ie: reactive variables)
	- computed refs
	- watchers
- ✅ HTML model engine:
	- reactive text content
	- reactive attributes
	- reactive events
	- two-way binding values
- ✅ Virtual DOM
	- best render speed
	- parse DOM from text dynamically (for `html` command and for SSR later)
- ✅ Useful commands:
	- `for` (list render)
	- `if`, `else`, `elseif` (condition render)
	- `html` (dangerously: raw HTML render)
- ⬛ Components support
- ⬛ CLI for Node.js (like Vue's CLI)
- ⬛ Server-Side Render (SSR)

# About me (the author)
Please allow me to brag about myself...

My English name is Jason, and my Chinese name is 谭镇洋 (Zhenyang, Tan), a 14-year-old boy. I'm a middle school student from China. I'm a boarder so that I can only program at weekends (exclude some special cases like holidays).

I started this project Vior just because I saw a middle school team called [`Bug-Duck`](https://github.com/Bug-Duck), they made a JS framework [`TNT.js`](https://github.com/Bug-Duck/tntjs) like Vue, and bragged about it. My internal drive for exellence motivated me to make one on my own. And I searched some data about Vue, learned some core principle of it, then I made it without help in a week overall (6 days from Vior v0.1.0 to v0.2.11, Sep. 2022). I think I did it!

What? Are you surprise with my English? LOL. I try my best to write in English by myself, and I'll use the translator in some special cases. Maybe programming makes my a lot stronger vocabulary and express ability than most middle school students. But I may make some funny language mistakes sometime, so your advice is most welcome!
